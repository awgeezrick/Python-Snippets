For any distribution with a well defined "mean"=M and "standard deviation"=StdDev,
the frequency distribution of the sample mean for a sample of size (n)
(a.k.a. sampling distribution of the sample mean, a.k.a. SDoSM)
==> normal distribution when n -> infinity with same "mean" as original distribution

if n=1, the frequency distribution is equal to the original distribution
when n -> infinity ==> normal distribution for number of samples -> infinity

The standard deviation of the SDoSM = standard error of the mean = StdDev / sqrt(n)
